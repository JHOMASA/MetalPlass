# Overview
The present project was created with the purpose of exposing the balance in one company. Furthermore, the data was on Excel previously, and the data was given on soles which is a Peruvian currency but the company instead works with the American dollar so, I applied the connection with one API to exchange the amount directly near real-time.
# What libraries you apply to fullfill this project?
Well I applied to follow libraries:

| Libraries     | Application                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Pandas        | Read the database            |
| Numpy         | Convert to numeric columns   |
| Dash          | Develop the dashboard        |
| Plotly        | Graph interactive            |

# What kind of functions involve each library? 

The libraries listed below were used getting the neccesity to the customer. As seen by the dashboard each of these libraries fullfill one specific purpose. In the case of pandas read the document and create dataframes. Numpy was replace the Nan values and selecting numeric columns. In dash the purpose is develop  the infraestructure to the dashboard appliying html. In the case of plotly the main propose was make interactive graphs.

# What is the contribution in creating this dashboard?
 First able the company works on Excel during more than 20 years so The purpose was develop one dashboard which let them the likely to visualize their values in near-real time and reduce wasting time in applying formulas in excel and exchange the values in soles to dollars. The reduction in time was approximatly 10 minutes per each day, because they did not work with one expecific exchange page.

# NOTE
The values ​​in the dashboard were simulated because the idea is to show the functionalities but not the real values ​​that are confidential
